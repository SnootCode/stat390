# R | UW Stat 390
This repository contains my Programming Assignments for UW STAT 390. These were all done in R. Some tasks include reading data from the internet, reexpressing data in tables and matrices to linearize it, plotting multiple figures onto a graph, and analyzing variance to perform regression.
